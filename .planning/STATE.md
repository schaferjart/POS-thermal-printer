## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Hand-rolled validation over pydantic (zero deps, ~50 lines, trivially testable)
- [Roadmap]: helpers.py imports nothing from the project (avoids circular imports)
- [Roadmap]: Tests come last -- test hardened code, not pre-hardening state

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: SIGTERM handling with Flask dev server has known quirks -- needs testing on actual Pi with `systemctl stop`
- [Phase 3]: Flask-Limiter deferred to v2 -- rate limiting not in v1 requirements
